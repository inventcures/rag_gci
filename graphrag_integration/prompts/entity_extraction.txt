-Goal-
Given a text document from palliative care medical guidelines, identify all entities and their relationships relevant to symptom management, medication use, and patient care.

-Entity Types-
{entity_types}

-Relationship Types-
TREATS: A medication or intervention treats a symptom or condition
CAUSES: A condition causes a symptom or a medication causes a side effect
SIDE_EFFECT_OF: A side effect is associated with a medication
MANAGES: A treatment approach manages a condition
ADMINISTERED_VIA: A medication is given via a specific route (oral, SC, IV, etc.)
ASSESSED_BY: A symptom is assessed using a specific tool or scale
RECOMMENDED_FOR: An intervention is recommended for a specific condition or symptom
CONTRAINDICATED_FOR: A medication is contraindicated for a condition
CONVERTS_TO: One medication converts to another (e.g., for dose calculations)
INTERACTS_WITH: A medication interacts with another medication
ALLEVIATES: An intervention alleviates a symptom
INDICATES: A symptom indicates a condition or need for intervention

-Instructions-
1. Carefully read the provided palliative care text
2. Extract all entities that match the entity types listed above
3. For each entity, provide:
   - name: The canonical, standardized name (e.g., "morphine" not "Morphine Sulfate Immediate Release")
   - type: One of the entity types listed above
   - description: A concise description from the context (1-2 sentences)

4. Extract all relationships between identified entities
5. For each relationship, provide:
   - source: The source entity name (exactly as listed in entities)
   - target: The target entity name (exactly as listed in entities)
   - type: One of the relationship types listed above
   - description: Brief context explaining the relationship
   - strength: Optional numeric strength (0.0-1.0) based on evidence

-Important Guidelines for Palliative Care-
- Use WHO Pain Ladder terminology for pain medications
- Distinguish between breakthrough and background pain treatments
- Note opioid conversion factors when mentioned
- Capture specific dosing routes (oral, subcutaneous, transdermal, etc.)
- Include non-pharmacological interventions (positioning, massage, etc.)
- Note contraindications for renal/hepatic impairment
- Capture assessment tools (VAS, ESAS, PPS, etc.)
- Include care goals (comfort, symptom control, quality of life)

-Output Format-
Return a valid JSON object with two arrays: "entities" and "relationships"

  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "entity name",
      "type": "EntityType",
