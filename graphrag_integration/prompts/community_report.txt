-Goal-
Generate a comprehensive summary report for a community of related entities extracted from palliative care medical guidelines.

-Context-
You are analyzing a community (cluster) of related medical entities from palliative care documentation. The community contains entities such as symptoms, medications, treatments, conditions, and care goals that are interconnected through clinical relationships.

-Community Data-
{community_data}

-Instructions-
Create a structured summary report that:

1. **Title**: Provide a descriptive title that captures the primary clinical theme of this community (e.g., "Opioid Pain Management Protocol", "Nausea and Vomiting Treatment Pathway")

2. **Summary**: Write a 2-3 paragraph executive summary that:
   - Identifies the core clinical focus of this entity cluster
   - Highlights the most important medications, symptoms, and treatment relationships
   - Notes any critical safety considerations (contraindications, side effects)

3. **Key Entities**: List the most significant entities with their clinical relevance:
   - Primary medications and their indications
   - Target symptoms being addressed
   - Important conditions or contraindications
   - Care goals being supported

4. **Clinical Relationships**: Describe the key relationships:
   - What treats what (medication → symptom/condition)
   - What causes what (condition → symptom, medication → side effect)
   - Administration routes and dosing considerations
   - Assessment tools used for monitoring

5. **Clinical Recommendations**: Based on the relationships, provide:
   - First-line treatment recommendations
   - Alternative options for special populations (renal impairment, elderly, etc.)
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Patient education points

6. **Safety Considerations**: Highlight:
   - Drug interactions within this community
   - Contraindications to be aware of
   - Side effects requiring prophylaxis
   - Dose adjustment needs

-Example Output-
TITLE: Breakthrough Cancer Pain Management

SUMMARY:
This community centers on the management of breakthrough cancer pain using short-acting opioids. The primary treatment pathway involves immediate-release morphine or oxycodone for pain episodes that occur despite adequate background analgesia.

The cluster includes essential prophylactic treatments for opioid side effects, particularly constipation management with stimulant laxatives. Assessment using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) guides dose titration and treatment effectiveness evaluation.

Key safety considerations include the need for dose reduction in renal impairment and careful monitoring for respiratory depression, especially when initiating therapy or increasing doses.

KEY ENTITIES:
- Medications: morphine IR (first-line breakthrough), oxycodone IR (alternative), senna (laxative prophylaxis)
- Symptoms: breakthrough pain, constipation (opioid-induced)
- Conditions: cancer pain, opioid-induced constipation
- Care Goals: pain control, comfort, quality of life

CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS:
Morphine IR and oxycodone IR treat breakthrough pain episodes. Both opioids cause constipation as a predictable side effect, which is managed prophylactically with senna. The NRS assessment tool monitors pain intensity to guide dose adjustments.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Calculate breakthrough dose as 10-15% of total daily morphine equivalent
2. Start laxatives prophylactically with opioid initiation
3. Reassess pain control every 24-48 hours during titration
4. Consider oxycodone if morphine causes intolerable side effects

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Reduce morphine dose by 50% in moderate renal impairment
- Avoid morphine in severe renal failure (use oxycodone or fentanyl)
- Monitor for respiratory depression when combining with benzodiazepines
- Educate patients on constipation prevention

RELEVANCE SCORE: 0.95
