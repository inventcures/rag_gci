**Palli Sahayak Update 💚**

Only 1-2% of 10M+ Indians needing palliative care receive it. We're building an AI voice helpline to change that.

**What it does:** Families call or WhatsApp in their own language (15+ supported), get clinically-validated guidance on pain management, symptoms, caregiving—24/7.

**Why it matters:** No app needed. No literacy required. Just a phone call at 2 AM when you need help most.

**Open source & adaptable** for any LMIC or underserved community globally.

Introducing **Palli Sahayak** 💚

The problem isn't just doctor shortage.

It's language. It's literacy. It's geography. It's the 3 AM panic when pain spikes.

Palli Sahayak speaks 15+ Indian languages, works via phone/WhatsApp, available 24/7.

No app. No internet needed for calls. Just dial. 💚
