# Prompt for Generating Presenter Script & Speaker Notes

## Original Request

Using the .pptx & .key files (v3 version),

I am the presenter, write my script as:

a. A standalone pdf script file in @docs/demo_script.pdf
b. Speaker notes for each slide in both the v3 versions of the .key & .pptx files

### Goals for Script & Speaker Notes

1. Speak crisp, less but impactful & leave audience with some food for thought, when my presentation ends
2. Always add a dash of humor & wit, and strategic pauses to engage the audience, and ask open ended queries to the audience, so they are engaged
3. The beginning of the presentation is very important, so important to have a "hook", to catch the audience interest at the start of the presentation

### Tags to Include (if & when required)

- `<pause>` - [duration (in seconds)]
- `<Ask a q>`
- `<Poll the audience>`
- `<Can someone tell me [engaging question hook]>`

### Presentation Timing

Total duration: **30 minutes**
- Slides presentation: ~15 minutes
- Live demo of the system in action: 10 minutes
- Q&A: 5 minutes
