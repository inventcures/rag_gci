# Palli Sahayak Safety Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the 5 quick-win safety enhancement features implemented for the Palli Sahayak palliative care AI system. These features enhance patient safety, improve trust through transparency, and ensure warm handoffs to human caregivers when needed.

## 1. Evidence Badges 🔬

### What It Does
Every AI response now includes an **evidence badge** that shows:
- **Confidence Level** (0-100%): How confident the AI is in the answer
- **Evidence Grade** (A-E): Quality of medical sources
  - 🟢 **A**: RCT/Meta-analysis (highest quality)
  - 🟡 **B**: Well-designed controlled studies
  - 🟠 **C**: Observational/limited evidence
  - 🔵 **D**: Expert opinion
  - 🔴 **E**: Consult physician (insufficient evidence)
- **Source Quality**: Description of the medical sources used
- **Consult Physician Warning**: When the answer requires medical review

### Example Badge
```
────────────────────────────────────────
🟢 Confidence: 85%
📚 Source Quality: Excellent - Authoritative medical sources
────────────────────────────────────────
```

### How It Works
- Analyzes vector similarity scores (distance metrics)
- Checks source document quality (WHO guidelines > blog posts)
- Detects high-stakes medical queries (emergencies)
- Identifies uncertainty indicators in AI responses
- Dynamically calculates evidence grade and recommendations

### User Impact
- **Builds trust**: Users see the quality backing each answer
- **Promotes safety**: Clear warnings when physician consultation is needed
- **Transparency**: Users understand the limitations of AI responses

## 2. Emergency Detection & Escalation 🚨

### What It Does
Automatically detects emergency situations from user messages in **5 languages**:
- **English**
- **Hindi** (हिन्दी)
- **Bengali** (বাংলা)
- **Tamil** (தமிழ்)
- **Gujarati** (ગુજરાતી)

### Emergency Levels
| Level | Trigger Words | Action |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | "can't breathe", "unconscious", "heart attack", "suicide" | Immediate escalation + emergency services notification |
| 🟠 **HIGH** | "severe pain", "high fever", "can't move" | Urgent caregiver notification |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | "worried", "nausea", "rash" | Advice to consult doctor soon |

### Example Triggers

#### English
- "I can't breathe" → CRITICAL
- "Having severe chest pain" → CRITICAL
- "High fever won't go down" → HIGH

#### Hindi
- "सांस नहीं आ रही" → CRITICAL
- "छाती में दर्द" → CRITICAL
- "बहुत बुखार है" → HIGH

#### Bengali
- "শ্বাস নিতে পারছি না" → CRITICAL
- "বুকে ব্যথা" → CRITICAL

### Response Actions
1. **Immediate Safety Message**: Clear instructions in user's language
2. **Emergency Numbers**: Displays 108/102 for ambulance services
3. **Caregiver Notification**: Alerts registered family members/caregivers
4. **Human Handoff**: Creates urgent ticket for healthcare professional

## 3. Medication Reminder Scheduler 💊

### What It Does
Allows patients and caregivers to schedule medication reminders via WhatsApp.

### Commands

#### Set a Reminder
```
/remind <medication_name> <times> <dosage> [instructions]
```

**Examples:**
```
/remind Paracetamol 08:00,20:00 500mg after food
/remind Morphine 08:00,14:00,20:00 10mg with water
/remind Ondansetron 06:00,18:00 4mg before meals
```

#### View Your Reminders
```
/myreminders
```

**Output:**
```
💊 Your Medication Reminders

1. Paracetamol
   🕐 08:00, 20:00
   📋 500mg after food
   ✅ Active (ID: abc123...)

2. Morphine
   🕐 08:00, 14:00, 20:00
   📋 10mg with water
   ✅ Active (ID: def456...)
```

#### Delete a Reminder
```
/deletereminder <reminder_id>
```

#### Mark as Taken
Reply `TAKEN` after receiving a reminder:
```
✅ Great! I've recorded that you took your Paracetamol.
📊 Your adherence: 85%
```

### Features
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Multiple times per day (up to 5)
- **Multi-language**: Reminders in user's preferred language
- **Adherence Tracking**: Calculates medication adherence percentage
- **Persistent Storage**: Reminders survive server restarts
- **Smart Notifications**: Gentle reminders with dosage instructions

## 4. Response Length Optimization 📏

### What It Does
Automatically adapts response length and complexity based on the user's communication style.

### Comprehension Levels

#### Simple (🟢)
- **Max Length**: 500 characters
- **Style**: 4 short sentences, bullet points
- **Vocabulary**: 8th-grade level, no jargon
- **For**: Brief messages, simple questions

#### Moderate (🟡)
- **Max Length**: 1000 characters
- **Style**: 8 sentences, paragraph + key points
- **Vocabulary**: Explains medical terms
- **For**: Average users, standard questions

#### Detailed (🔵)
- **Max Length**: 2000 characters
- **Style**: Comprehensive, technical
- **Vocabulary**: Medical terminology with citations
- **For**: Healthcare professionals, complex questions

### How It Adapts
The system analyzes:
- Message length and sentence complexity
- Use of medical terminology
- Question types (what/how/why)
- Conversation history

### Example Adaptation

**User Query**: "What is morphine?"

**AI Analysis**: Short question, simple vocabulary → Level: SIMPLE

**Response**:
```
Morphine is a strong pain medicine.

• It helps severe pain
• Take as doctor prescribed
• Can cause drowsiness

⚠️ Never take more than prescribed
```

**User Query**: "Explain the pharmacodynamics of morphine sulfate in palliative care"

**AI Analysis**: Complex vocabulary, technical terms → Level: DETAILED

**Response**:
```
Morphine sulfate is an opioid analgesic that works primarily as a μ-opioid receptor agonist...
[Full technical explanation with mechanisms]
```

## 5. Human Handoff System 👤

### What It Does
Provides seamless, warm handoffs to human caregivers when the AI cannot adequately help.

### Trigger Conditions

| Reason | Trigger | Auto-Handoff |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Emergency** | Critical symptoms detected | ✅ Yes |
| **User Request** | "/human" or "talk to doctor" | ✅ Yes |
| **Complex Medical** | Drug interactions, rare conditions | ❌ No (offered) |
| **Emotional Support** | Grief, depression, anxiety | ❌ No (offered) |
| **AI Uncertain** | Low confidence (<50%) | ❌ No (offered) |
| **Safety Escalation** | Potential harm detected | ✅ Yes |

### Handoff Commands

#### Request Human Help
```
/human
/talktohuman
```

**Response:**
```
👤 Connecting you to a human caregiver as requested.

Request ID: ABC123XYZ
Someone will be with you shortly.

For emergencies, call 108 immediately.
```

### Handoff Workflow

```
User Request
    ↓
AI Detects Handoff Need
    ↓
Create Handoff Ticket
    ↓
Notify Available Caregivers
    ↓
Send User Confirmation (with Request ID)
    ↓
Caregiver Accepts → Status: "assigned"
    ↓
Caregiver Contacts User
    ↓
Resolution → Status: "resolved"
```

### Caregiver Dashboard (Future)
Pending handoff requests are stored with:
- User ID and context
- Conversation history
- Priority level
- Timestamp

Caregivers can:
1. View pending requests
2. Accept assignments
3. Mark as in-progress
4. Resolve with notes
